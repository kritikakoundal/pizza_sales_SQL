Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL 🍕📊
In this project, I utilized SQL to analyze pizza sales data and derive valuable insights for decision-making. Key highlights include calculating total orders, identifying top-selling pizza types, and understanding revenue trends. By joining tables and grouping orders by date, I was able to determine the most popular pizza sizes, peak order times, and the highest revenue-generating pizzas. These insights contribute to optimizing menu offerings and streamlining operations.
